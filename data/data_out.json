                "Given my recent experiences and observations, I would suggest exploring a concept called \"Smart Green Mixed-Use Cities.\" This project could focus on designing urban spaces that harmoniously blend smart technology with greenery and mixed-use developments to promote sustainability, resident wellness, and community involvement. By leveraging IoT devices for efficient resource management while integrating ample green spaces, such cities can create a better quality of life for its residents. Additionally, involving the local communities in planning processes could ensure these future cities are not only technologically advanced but also truly reflective of their inhabitants' needs and aspirations.",
                "Considering my interest in bio-design and its potential to address pollution levels while promoting urban biodiversity, I'd like to explore \"A Bio-Design Approach towards Sustainable Urban Landscapes: Integrating Vertical Farms and Eco-friendly Buildings within Future City Planning.\" This topic will delve into how bio-design principles can be integrated with vertical farming initiatives and eco-conscious building materials to create a harmonious, sustainable environment in future urban settings.\n\nBy studying the impact of these integrations on local ecosystems, pollution reduction, and overall well-being, we could provide valuable insights for city planners, architects, and policymakers striving to create greener cities that prioritize human health and environmental stewardship.\n\nIn addition, this topic would allow me to expand on my recent paper on urban biodiversity by demonstrating how a bio-design approach can enhance ecological richness in urban landscapes while fostering community resilience against climate change impacts.",
                "As a graphical designer with insights from my research into urban environments' social impacts and personal involvement in community renewal projects, I suggest exploring \"Designing Inclusive Future Cities: Mitigating the Mental Health Impact of Urban Surveillance.\" This topic would address creating urban spaces that prioritize mental well-being while considering diverse community needs. It can delve into incorporating privacy measures and public awareness to counterbalance potential negative effects from increased surveillance in smart cities, ensuring the design fosters a sense of safety without compromising personal freedoms.",
                "My proposal is to build a green city all using solar energy",
                "My proposal is to make ai to be the mayer of the city",
                "My proposal is to Develop modular, vertical urban clusters connected by high-speed transit."
